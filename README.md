# Overview

Using Selenium I built my first 4 web scrapers to pull data from different Rolling Stone music lists. 
Each set of data was put into a pandas DataFrame, and saved to a CSV file. 

###Motiovation:
I was interested in reading through Rolling Stone's lists, but didn't want to have to scroll through all the extra information,
and switch to a new page every 50 enteries.
